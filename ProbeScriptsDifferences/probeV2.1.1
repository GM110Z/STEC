For each sample, it looks for a matching pair of files: a protein FASTA (*.faa) and a GenBank file (*.gbff or *.gbk) with the same basename.

It runs HMMER hmmsearch twice on each FASTA (model1 and model2) at score threshold -T/--incT (default 5), writing --domtblout.

It parses the domtblouts to get the hit IDs (protein_id or locus_tag), then maps those to CDS genomic coordinates in the GenBank using Biopython.

If it finds hits for both models on the same contig whose features are within max_gap (default 30 kbp), it extracts the span covering both hits from the GenBank and writes a sliced GenBank file for that interval.

If no qualifying pair exists, it tries a fallback: if thereâ€™s a model1 hit with no downstream model2 hit on that contig, it extracts from that model1 hit to the end of the contig.

It appends the chosen interval to Locus-coordinates.txt, and cleans up temporary HMMER outputs.
